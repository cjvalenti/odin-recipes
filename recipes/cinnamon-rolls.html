        <ol>
            <li>Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C). Brush an 8-inch square baking dish with 1 tablespoon of the melted butter.</li>
            <li>To make the dough: Whisk flour, white sugar, baking powder, and salt together in a large bowl. Work 3 tablespoons softened butter into flour mixture using your hands until butter is lentil-sized.</li>
            <li>Pour milk into flour-butter mixture and stir with a rubber spatula until a soft dough forms.</li>
            <li>Turn dough out onto a well-floured work surface and roll dough into a 10- x 10-inch square. Brush surface of dough with remaining 2 tablespoons melted butter.</li>
            <li>To make the filling: Whisk Â¼ cup white sugar, brown sugar, and cinnamon together in a small bowl. Sprinkle 1 tablespoon cinnamon-sugar mixture in the bottom of the prepared baking dish. Sprinkle remaining cinnamon sugar over butter-brushed dough.</li>
            <li>Roll dough around filling to form a log; cut log into 9 rolls about 1-inch wide; place rolls, cut-side up, in the prepared baking dish.</li>
            <li>Bake in the preheated oven until rolls are puffed and lightly golden, 20 to 25 minutes.</li>
